XML-Writer-Simpler

(Version 0.1)

This is a convenience module for writing XML. It's a subclass of
C<XML::Writer>, with a single convenience method so you usually won't have
to deal with remembering to call startTag(), endTag(), and
emptyTag().

This module is lies somewhere in between XML::Generator and
XML::Writer::Nest. It nests calls like XML::Generator, but allows for
arbitrary subroutine calls as well. It requires fewer braces in general than
XML::Writer::Nest.

This module is a subclass of XML::Writer, so if you can't do what you want to
with the tag method, you can fall back to the methods native to XML::Writer.
